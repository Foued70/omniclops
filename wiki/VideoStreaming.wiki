It's possible to stream video over a network using [http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/ gstreamer].  This can be useful for remotely operated vehicles or surveillance systems.

On the server:

{{{
    omniclops --dev /dev/video0 --stream --headless
}}}

then on the client:

{{{
    gst-launch tcpclientsrc host=[ip] port=5000 ! multipartdemux ! jpegdec ! autovideosink
}}}

To do a local test you can use _localhost_ as the IP address.
